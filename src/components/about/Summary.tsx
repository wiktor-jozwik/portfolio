        In the realm of Node.js, NestJS, and TypeScript, I specialize in
        crafting efficient code from business ideas. I like to be part of
        business modelling and architecture planning of the system I&apos;m
        working on. I love to write as clean code as possible but I understand
        the most important thing is to deliver the code and meet the business
        needs.
